# Facility Booking System

## Get started

You need:

* .NET 10
* Node.js and pnpm
* DevTunnel
* Telegram Bot Token

Create a tunnel:

```powershell
devtunnel create fbs -a -d "Facility Booking System";
devtunnel port create fbs -p 5204 --protocol http;
devtunnel port create fbs -p 7172 --protocol https;
devtunnel host fbs;
```

Visit the URL provided and grant access.

In future runs, you only need to start the tunnel:

```powershell
devtunnel host fbs;
```

Take note of the URL provided and set it as environment variables as show below.

```powershell
cd ./Fbs.WebApi;
dotnet user-secrets set "Telegram:Token" "<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>";
dotnet user-secrets set "Telegram:WebhookUrl" "<YOUR_DEVTUNNEL_HERE>/Bot";
```

You need to provide the service account with access to the facility spreadsheet.

Start the AppHost project, which runs the API and the web app (on http://localhost:3000) and prints a link to the
Aspire dashboard:

```powershell
dotnet run --project ./Fbs.AppHost/Fbs.AppHost.csproj;
```

Or, with the [Aspire CLI](https://aspire.dev):

```powershell
aspire run;
```

## Testing

The API tests use [TUnit](https://tunit.dev) and run the API in memory, with Google and Telegram faked, so they need
no secrets:

```powershell
dotnet test;
```

## Deploying

Login cookies are encrypted with ASP.NET Core Data Protection keys. The Docker image keeps them in `/app/keys`, so
mount a persistent volume at that path or every redeploy generates new keys and logs everyone out.
